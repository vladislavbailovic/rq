Project `rq` - `jq`-like data processor
=======================================

`rq` is a CLI data handling utility for plain-text data files (JSON, YAML - and possibly others in the future). It is meant to be an experiment in learning Rust through implementing a parser for `jq`-like dialect: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters

So I can suck in a whole new language!
